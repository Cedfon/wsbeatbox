Server side helpers for WebSocket build on top of `socketify`.

## Overview

Simple utility tools to help create and manage the Websocket server side.
Development based on use cases from my other projects. Features will be implemented as cases are encountered.

Initially created to handle communications for a multiplayer game running in the browser where we are required to use python as server technology.

Motivated by the fact that using `socketio` requires having to use it on both sides and I don't want to force the use of any dependencies on the client side for communication.
Also, `SocketIO` seems to really suck even though it is the most popular proposed solution on the internets.
